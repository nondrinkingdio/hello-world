# hello-world

I am an undergraduate majoring in ME.After one-year studying about ME, I am a little disappointed at it now. 
And the mechanics in my country wasn't a pleasant job because of its backward industry base.
So the coding has garadually become a way or even comfort in my life.
Maybe it will become my job ?
